The first androids were created by humanoid peoples in their own images, but after the technology that animated the living constructs spread, androids began displaying a fantastic diversity of forms. Androids in the Pact Worlds were originally designed as servants, but today androids stand as equals to other citizens under the Pact. Many androids have formed their own independent communities, while others integrate seamlessly into Pact Worlds societies. Unlike many other technological constructs, androids are more than intricate synthetic organs and complex programming, and each possesses their own soul.</em></p><hr /><p>Androids thrive in nearly any environment and exist as part of myriad cultures, meaning they can be found almost anywhere in the galaxy. Many androids are curious about their origins, traveling alone or with others in search of answers to a variety of metaphysical and material questions about their identities and the greater cosmos. Androids are diverse, with few individuals sharing the exact same appearance despite their manufactured state.</p><p>If you want to roleplay a character on a journey of self-discovery, you should play an android.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Try to avoid having others take advantage of you.</li><li>Seek to understand your purpose in the wider galaxy.</li><li>Judge others based on how they treat service workers, blue collar laborers, fans, or pets.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Have trouble parsing your emotions or understanding when you express them.</li><li>Secretly covet your lack of aging.</li><li>Have some level of guilt for their ancestors' use of your ancestry as laborers</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Androids are biomechanical constructs who typically resemble humanoids with glowing circuitry. Most were created in specialized birthing sites called foundries. Older variants of androids (such as androids on Golarion from the Pathfinder RPG) were primarily biological, but androids in the modern era usually incorporate more technological components and synthetic elements into their bodies. Androids need to eat and sleep, but they don't reproduce, don't age, and have no innate concept of gender—though many express humanoid gender identities or shift fluidly between them. Most androids voluntarily release their bodies after a century or so, allowing new souls to inhabit them in a process called renewal.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Androids tend to be cautious when visiting new places and meeting new people. Once comfortable, androids tend to form tight bonds of friendship and kinship, forming found families, and adopting entire streets and communities as their home, rather than remaining confined by the boundaries formed by walls. Androids often go out of their way to help one another and their chosen families and communities, and most loathe to end the life of another android, knowing that to do so ends not one life, but the countless other souls who could one day inhabit that body.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Androids hold a variety of religious and philosophical views, with individuals sometimes collecting beliefs and practices through decades of lived experiences. Similar to elves and other long-lived ancestries, androids tend to view things differently than beings with shorter life spans. Many androids are patient in achieving their goals, and they might create plans that span decades, if not centuries, hoping they'll still be alive to experience the results. Elder androids who voluntarily pass on to the next part of their cycle might choose to bequeath their goals to the next soul to inhabit their body.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong> discover your origins, plan for the future, help others achieve liberation</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong> engage in reckless or self-destructive behavior</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Asha, Blue-17, Celita, Daniv, Emene-3, Era-4, Flick, Garro, Historia-6, Hope-1, Iseph, Melody, Naga, Olas, Omen, Prime, Ruby-17, Stringer, Twenty Six, Urdun, Verity-3, and Yose.</p><h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Android Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Charisma</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

                    "name": "Vesk",
                    "text": "<p><em>Vesk are a warmongering, reptilian people who conquered the eight worlds in their solar system shortly after they developed spaceflight, forming the Veskarium empire. Vesk tend to embrace conflict and respect strength and military might.</em></p><hr /><p>Vesk have a long history of conflict, first as conquerors within their own star system and later in clashes with neighboring stellar powers, such as the Pact Worlds and the Swarm. Currently, the Veskarium are poised on the brink of war with the Azlanti Star Empire. Conflict permeates most aspects of vesk cultures, creating powerful militaristic empires devoted to the bloody worship of their warrior god Damoritosh. Their brutal history and militaristic values have shaped vesk society, which often embraces conflict and values strength, duty, and honor. Individual vesk are just as likely to apply these cultural values to other aspects of life besides battle, notably in business and sports, and vesk might abandon or oppose the ruthless values enforced by the rulers of their homeworlds entirely. It's up to each vesk to claim their role as a conqueror or a collaborator—or something else entirely.</p><p>If you want a character who's duty bound, honorable, and stoic, you should play a vesk.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Relish the chance to prove yourself in combat against worthy opponents.</li><li>Have a strong sense of duty and honor.</li><li>Surprise your companions with tenderness and emotional outbursts in private.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Respect and fear your brutal reputation but appreciate your strength as an ally.</li><li>Mistake your stoicism for heartlessness.</li><li>Fear facing you in battle.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Vesk stand up to 7 feet tall, are generally muscular, and are covered in tough, scaly skin. Spiky horns grow from their skulls and form bony \"beards\" along their jaws that sometimes extend down their spines to their powerful tails. Vesk scales generally appear in shades of green but can also display vibrant, mottled coloration that's sometimes considered an indicator of health and attractiveness.</p><p>Vesk adopted technological weapons early in their history but retain the brutal claws and teeth of natural predators. They take great care in grooming and painting their scales and claws to showcase their personal style and intimidate others.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Vesk society is highly organized and militaristic. Vesk first dwelled on a single planet but quickly spread to other worlds in their system. Today, the name for these conquered worlds is the Veskarium, with each given a number to mark their distance from the sun (such as Vesk-6). Vesk Prime, the vesk ancestral home, is the seat of Veskarium government and the heart of their traditional culture.</p><p>In the Veskarium, social status is based around battlefield experience, usually earned through military service or mercenary work. Vesk culture strictly dictates everything from interpersonal behavior to mode of dress, and many vesk take pride in upholding these traditions. Vesk value stoicism outside of intimate relationships (including those forged through intense battle) and often follow rigid rules of etiquette. Breaking social customs or insulting a stranger could trigger a violent blood debt, so many vesk default to polite aloofness.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Most vesk in the Veskarium honor Damoritosh the Conqueror, god of duty and war, and his army of battle saints. In life, the saints were mortal paragons who embodied vesk cultural values and attained divinity after earning Damoritosh's blessing; now, they're worshipped alongside their deity. A typical vesk faces all of life's struggles armed with ideals of honor and strength, recognizing that not all conflicts occur on the battlefield. Many vesk find comfort in rigid systems of law, while others hold their personal sense of morality above all else—in either case, most vesk don't hesitate to fight for what they believe is right. Even while fighting, vesk apply a code of honor to their actions, and conflicts within the Veskarium tend to be as disciplined as they are violent, stretching to accommodate opposing sides following the prescribed order of war and maintaining honor. A typical vesk always respects their opponent and shuns tactics considered dishonorable, such as executing prisoners or harming civilians.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong> battle honorably, keep private emotions in check, never show weakness to enemies</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong> betray an ally</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Vesk names typically combine elements of their parents' names as well as those of other prominent ancestors. Companions often shorten these names for casual use, but doing so without permission is a grave insult. Some vesk take on epithets that signify their victories in combat, such as \"Three Guns\", \"Voidwalker\", or \"Squadeater\".</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Abazobari, Ahadigar, Asthonad, Dotralan, Evdokayo, Goromitali, Julukesh, Katara, Obozaya, Oromeras, Radokama, Sarangari, Sobok, Terikoraz, Vindasorn, and Yuluzak.</p><h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Vesk Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Strength, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Wisdom</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Vesk, One regional language of your choice</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

Barathus rewrite their own genetic code instinctively and at will, shaping their bodies into a stunning array of unique forms.</em></p><hr /><p>Barathus are floating, blimplike beings that edit their own genetic code and merge together into countless bizarre and beautiful configurations. Early-stage barathus tend to be individualistic and gravitate toward learning about other cultures, while more experienced barathus develop a fluid sense of self and seek communion with others on a deeper level.</p><p>If you want a character with an alien appearance and mindset who adapts to any situation, you should play a barathu.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Enjoy new experiences and eagerly adapt to new ideas.</li><li>Change your body frequently based on the environment or situation.</li><li>Merge with your companions or copy their genetic structure to learn about them.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Are intrigued by your unique anatomy.</li><li>Admire your adaptability.</li><li>Struggle to recognize your frequently changing appearance.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>The average barathu has a floating, blimplike body with colorful tentacles and limbs dangling from it. Since barathus frequently change their bodies at a genetic level, a barathu might experience dozens of unique evolutions in their lifetime. Barathus mold themselves into larger, more fantastical forms after merging. Barathu conglomerates might appear as enormous jellyfish, blooming ooze-flowers, or rainbow-colored rings.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Most barathus have a fluid sense of self. In their early stage, young barathus often take inspiration from other cultures and exhibit more individualistic tendencies, then temper this worldview as they gain experience and merge with others. A barathu can merge with other barathus into a compound being called a conglomerate. A barathu conglomerate is greater than the sum of its parts, with an entirely new identity and worldview created by the fusion. Barathus who split back into their component parts recall only hazy memories from their time within the conglomerate, described by some as watching a holovid reel. While young barathus tend to find this disconcerting, most older barathus consider joining a conglomerate an honor. As their bodies and memories begin to fade with age, many barathus choose to merge permanently with a conglomerate, letting go of their individual self to join a greater consciousness and being.</p><p>Because many barathus \"move past\" individuality as they age and embrace adaptation and merging as a solution to most problems and disputes, they can have difficulty fitting in among other societies. Many barathus have trouble understanding greed, ownership, jealousy, and stagnation, often forgetting that their companions can't change their own bodies without magical or technological aid, or their viewpoints without great consideration and time. They're unaccustomed to the static.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Many barathus identify with Oras and choose to explore his faith, seeing their own constant evolution as a mirror of his journey from cell to god. Barathus who explored Liavara and experienced its cosmic song have their own beliefs, which they share in songs unfathomable to everyone except other Dreamers.

Today, humans can be found almost anywhere doing almost anything.</em></p><hr /><p>Human ambition has created empires throughout the stars. The Pact Worlds have a strong human presence, and the expansion of the Azlanti Star Empire is a more sinister expression of humanity's potential. Though the Azlanti Star Empire is considered a bastion of oppression, there are countless diverse and inclusive societies established by humanity across the galaxy, and humans played a role in founding the most famous port in the known cosmos: Absalom Station. Regardless of their motives, humans thrive in both urban sprawls and in the most remote galactic frontiers.</p><p>If you want an adaptable character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Strive to achieve greatness, either for personal gain or on behalf of a cause.</li><li>Yearn to explore and experience the cosmos.</li><li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Respect your flexibility and usual open-mindedness.</li><li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li><li>Struggle to recognize your frequently changing appearance.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Humans' physical characteristics vary based on their lineage and homeworld. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Some environments produce distinct human appearances, such as crimson-skinned hylki humans living on Akiton. Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Human societies are as varied as the worlds they thrive on. While the Azlanti Star Empire seeks to recapture an imagined era of glory by isolating and idealizing an ancient culture from lost Golarion, most human groups coexist with other species in diverse communities. These vast cultural differences can be both fascinating and frustrating to other ancestries. Human settlements just a few miles apart may have wildly different governmental styles and social mores.</p><p>Furthermore, human societies are always in flux—constantly adapting to new ideas, discoveries, and technologies. Despite their diverse lifestyles and outlooks, humans are adaptive and ambitious—traits which have driven them to explore the unknown, forge their own futures, and settle on countless planets, creating lives for themselves by either integrating into alien societies or creating communities and settlements on distant worlds.</p><p>Of all the common ancestries in the Pact Worlds, humans were perhaps the hardest hit by the Gap. Due to Golarion's disappearance, humans were left with relatively little evidence with which to puzzle out and reconstruct their society. While Absalom Station and other worlds with large human populations contain documents related to the ancient history of humanity, how much relevance this should have to modern human society is a hotly debated topic. For some, these ancient documents offer a chance to connect with their origin, pulling everything from names and philosophies to ancient factions forward into the modern era. To some, this approach is seen as counterintuitive.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Humans often believe in the structures they've established, so many adhere to the ideals of the Pact or follow the laws of other regions or organizations, like the Azlanti Star Empire or the Free Captains. Many also cleave tightly to faith, philosophy, or religion, finding in these intellectual and spiritual touchstones confidence, clarity, and comfort. Since humanity eagerly embraces change, there are always humans who oppose societal norms by challenging longstanding beliefs or laws. These ideals, whether societal, intellectual, or spiritual, are often used as a driving force or justification for a human's behavior and ambitions.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong> explore the cosmos, strive for greatness, devote yourself to a greater cause</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong> waste what little time you have</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally follow ancient traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names.

Shortly after the period of lost history known as the Gap, they were convinced by members of their progenitor species, witchwyrds, to leave Kasath and settle on distant the red world in the Golarion system known as Akiton. Centuries later they arrived in the Pact Worlds system aboard the worldship Idari, only to find a thriving planet already inhabited by multitudes of other species. Most kasathas decided to stay onboard the Idari, while others peacefully emigrated to the many planets of the Pact Worlds, where their scientific and metaphysical knowledge are a welcomed addition to the diverse star system. Today, kasathas are found throughougt the Pact Worlds and even in several Near Space systems.</p><p>If you want a character who strives for balance and harmony, you should play a kasatha.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Seek to maintain balance and harmony between yourself and others, as well as among cosmic forces.</li><li>Find traditional weaponry to be more honorable than modern munitions.</li><li>Keep your mouth hidden with a scarf or mask while in public.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Assume your respect for tradition gives you an inflexible view of the universe.</li><li>Go to you for advice and expect you to provide guidance and wisdom.</li><li>Take your prioritization of personal dignity as a sign of elitism.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Kasathas are humanoids with gray skin, four arms, and pure black eyes. They have an elongated skull that extends behind their neck, further accentuating their tall frames. After evolving to survive migrations on a massive world, many kasathas have wiry bodies with thick musculature that makes them strong despite their lanky appearance.</p><p>Kasathas reach adulthood around the age of 25 and typically live for 100 to 140 years. Kasathas of mixed ancestry tend to come from families who left Idari during the species' initial wave of emigration; these kasathas often use their Tempering to seek out elders who can teach them more about their traditions. Many kasathan familial communities appreciate the unique perspective these individuals can provide as kasathas learn to adapt to new homes and environments.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Kasathan culture prioritizes stability and balance, with a respect for honor, tradition, and the importance of upholding and respecting one's edicts and anathema. Most kasathas form matriarchal and nomadic clans and subclans organized into a complex myriad of \"Great Families.\" While each Great Family has its own set of customs and traditions, common staples include concealing one's mouth from all but your most intimate companions, a belief in the honor of fighting with melee weapons, and a coming-of-age period known as the Tempering, a year-long journey in which a kasatha is encouraged to test their limits, learn from different cultures, and forgo familial customs in the hopes of learning firsthand the importance of stability and tradition.</p><p>In the ancient past, kasathas developed a shared language, which had hundreds of dialects and sublanguages derived from Kasath's ancient nations and powerful Great Families. Dozens more dialects originated on the Idari during its long journey across the galaxy, usually derived from sectors, neighborhoods, and vocations. Thanks to their longstanding respect for tradition and reverence of history, many of these dialects live on and are still spoken in the Pact Worlds to this day.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Kasathan cultures hold custom and ancestral tradition in high regard, but each kasatha follows their own unique set of traditions, combining the rituals of their clan with those they develop through life experience.

They have a well-earned reputation for being ambitious, driven, and self-reflective, with a perpetual desire for growth—both in terms of personal advancement and self-improvement. This cultural push to know oneself, embrace one's strengths, surpass one's past successes, and strive for ever-greater goals drives lashuntas to value education, focus, and training, and to embrace new discoveries, technologies, and modes of thought. While many lashuntas today still fulfill the traditional role of the enlightened warrior or the consummate scholar, time and shifting social norms have gifted lashuntas the freedom to branch out in countless ways, developing their own interests, hobbies, and genetic expressions, with no regard to their heritage or societal standing.</p><p>If you want to play a character who strives for self-perfection and has innate psychic abilities, you should play a lashunta.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Constantly strive to improve yourself through practicing skills and honing your powers.</li><li>Prioritize learning and diplomacy if you're a damaya, or physique and tactical prowess if you're a korasha—or if you're an unbound lashunta, you don't fit into either mold.</li><li>Hold yourself to a much higher standard than you apply to others.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Think you're a perfectionist and find your pursuit of self-improvement tiresome.</li><li>Distrust your psychic abilities, fearing you'll read their minds.</li><li>Idealize or label you based on your chosen heritage.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>To survive on an inimical homeworld, lashuntas evolved adaptive genetics that allow them to develop into one of two heritages: damayas or korashas. Damayas tend to be tall and graceful with delicate features and are traditionally pushed toward intellectual pursuits and political occupations. Korashas are shorter, more muscular, and gravitate toward military service, exploration, and wartime leadership. Regardless of heritage, all lashuntas have short forehead antennae that focus their telepathy, with colorful bumps and markings on their face unique to each individual. Lashuntas produce pheromones that subtly broadcast their moods in ways that other ancestries may find alluring or unnerving.</p><p>Around puberty, lashuntas traditionally choose whether to express damaya or korasha genetics—a decision that determines their physical development and influences their societal roles. Lashuntas achieve their choice through a combination of psychic ritual and gene therapy. Today, many young lashuntas have chosen to tread their own path and abstain from this choice, instead becoming \"unbound.\" Unbound lashuntas defy traditional roles and labels, and they may express traits and innate proclivities common to both or neither group. A growing minority of lashuntas instead push for further genetic diversification and aim to express unique or long-buried genetic permutations, pioneering entirely new chosen heritages. Whether such experimentation will prove fruitful is unknown.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Since time immemorial, lashuntas have dwelled in sprawling, picturesque cities along the shores and wildlands of Castrovel, a lush jungle world teeming with dangerous predators and extreme weather. These independent settlements are protected by a mighty military caste of psychic warriors, technological defenses, and magical countermeasures. The most iconic of these soldiers are the shotalashu cavalry, lightly armored riders who form telepathic bonds with (and take their name from) their saurian mounts.</p><p>Lashuntas share their homeworld of Castrovel with communities of reclusive elves and empires of fanatically orderly insectile formians. Peace between lashuntas and formians remains tentative and hard earned after unknown ages of open warfare, which began millennia before the Gap.

Their homeworld was recently freed from occupation by the Veskarium and they've joined the Pact Worlds.</em></p><hr /><p>Pahtras evolved on a low-gravity jungle world called Pulonis, where they fought a generations-spanning war for independence from their Veskarium conquerors. Recently, pahtra freedom fighters defeated the last Veskarium occupiers, then voted to join the Pact Worlds as a sovereign planet. Today, Pulonis is a lush, verdant world wracked by dangerous magnetic storms and scarred by the Veskarium's brutal invasion. The struggles of survival have influenced many pahtra traditions, leading to a culture of competitive wargames, time-honored mysticism, and unorthodox technology. Music accompanies everything in pahtra culture, from popular entertainment to traditional battle tactics, with martial combat even categorized as a form of battle dance.</p><p>If you want to play a character who fights for freedom with grace and style, you should play a pahtra.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Enjoy friendly competition.</li><li>Be a talented performer or cultured aficionado of a wide variety of music and dance.</li><li>Hold true to your ancestral traditions and refuse to kneel to cruel despots.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Think you struggle with computers, vehicles, and other technology.</li><li>Envy your musical talent.</li><li>Assume you are looking for an excuse to prove yourself in a fight.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Pahtras are feline humanoids covered in fur. Their coats vary from black, white, blue, calico, bi-colored, and tabby, often possessing unique patterns of irregular shapes that seers traditionally use to divine an individual's potential. Their eyes vary across all colors of the visible spectrum. Typical pahtras stand between six and seven feet tall, with elongated limbs and flexible joints. Their physiology is highly mutable, and families that leave Pulonis often find their children developing stockier and more muscular bodies as they adjust to higher gravity.</p><p>Pahtras have sharp teeth and retractable claws on their hands and feet. They have a unique set of sensory organs across their muzzles, with functions varying from individual to individual. The most common of these peripheral nerves include harmonic sensory apparatuses that can feel sound. Others have longer whiskers that can sense magnetic or magical energies. Some pahtras can even sniff out infection or illness, making them invaluable as health care providers, colonists exploring new worlds, or even traditional brewers, who can hone the skill to detect the presence of unwanted contaminants.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Pahtra cultures are steeped in tradition and highly competitive, with individuals vying for recognition and resources in a struggle that mimics the harsh natural order of their planet. Before the Veskarium invasion, technological advancement on Pulonis stalled because of the world's unpredictable magnetic storms. Even today, Pulonian technological development focuses on ceramics, bioengineering, chemistry, and magic. After breaking from the Veskarium, residents of Pulonis's nation-states overwhelmingly voted to join the Pact Worlds, and they're still acclimating to this new political allegiance.</p><p>The majority of pahtras are asexual. Most seek loving and life-long relationships with partners, but in modern times few commit to having children. Pahtras bear litters of six to eight children and prefer communal child-rearing, which allows parents to retain their individuality.</p><p>When a pahtra comes of age at 15, they participate in ceremonial wargames in the wilderness. Though these ancient rites of battle and survival are dangerous and last several weeks, they remain popular today, and their results often determine a pahtra's career prospects and place in society. Those pahtras wishing to participate in a less dangerous fashion instead participate in dance competitions, complex choreographed ritual dances, or grueling marathons, which offer participants less prestige but have a much lower mortality rate.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Many pahtras cling fiercely to their ancestral Pulonian traditions in an effort to keep their cultures alive after enduring generations of oppression by the Veskarium. Pulonian culture values personal success and standing out from one's peers and views all existence as a great song, with each person, event, and action adding to the galactic symphony that began at the dawn of time. Most pahtras enjoy healthy and productive competition, believing that one's true potential can only emerge from struggle. Underhandedly sabotaging or blatantly disrespecting a rival who follows the rules of a competition is a grave offense and usually seen as a sign of weakness. Pahtras make an exception to this code when facing a dishonorable foe, such as invaders from the technologically advanced Veskarium. In such cases, any form of resistance is acceptable, and the use of \"dirty\" tactics is considered a wise counter to a foe's unfair advantages. Many religious pahtras pray to Meyel, an ancestral deity of dance, music, and battle worshipped on Pulonis.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong> challenge yourself and your comrades, take pride in your accomplishments, perform music and dance daily</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong> abandon your ancestral traditions, give up your identity, bow to tyrants</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Traditionally, a seer divines a pahtra child's future based on their fur patterns. While most pahtra parents embrace this predestination ritual wholeheartedly, others consider it an opportunity to celebrate their child's birth and survival, give their child a traditional name, and pay homage to their ancestors. These pahtras instead interpret the mystic readings as ancient wisdom to be applied broadly, rather than dictating a specific fate or destiny for their child.

Shirrens' exoskeletons are often colorful, iridescent, and may have spots or other patterns.</p><p>Shirrens have three sexes with roles in reproduction: male, female, and host. Female and male shirrens provide eggs and sperm respectively, and hosts incubate the fertilized eggs while adding their own genetic material. In some shirren communities, a single host incubates for many partners, while three-party unions are common in others. Shirren young spend their first 2 years in a wormlike larval form. A parent may carry their larval child in a protective container to let them safely experience the world until they reach the pupal stage. Pupae undergo a second metamorphosis around eight years old before settling into their mature form. During each metamorphosis, shirrens instinctively and unconsciously edit and adjust their own appearance, physiology, and sex, to better represent the person they're maturing into.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Shirrens are highly individualistic, having escaped from the Swarm thanks to an adaptation to their physiology that causes immense pleasure when they make choices for themselves. This freedom of choice is respected and nourished by shirren culture, leading shirrens to adapt themselves to a wide variety of beliefs, philosophies, and professions. Shirrens are highly communal and tend to feel lonely unless they're part of a group. Once a shirren chooses a community for themselves, they often seek to foster teamwork and prioritize what's best for the group over what only benefits them as individuals, all while retaining their autonomy.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Shirrens define themselves by their choices and bristle against all forms of oppression.

They have six arms, leading to their use of the slang term \"allsix\" for giving one's best effort. A skittermander's body is covered in colorful fur, most commonly in vibrant shades of blue, green, purple, or red. Skittermanders are mammals that begin life in a non-sapient larval stage called a whelp. Skitterwhelps look like miniature skittermanders, save that they scrabble around on all eight limbs, have bigger ears, and have a secondary, tube-like mouth that sprouts from their abdomen. Skitterwhelps fend for themselves after birth, devouring fruits, seeds, leaves, raw meat, and any other source of nutrients they can cram into their mouths. A skitterwhelp's stomach-mouth can attach to large prey and secretes numbing saliva, enabling them to cling to large animals and feed on them over time like a furry leech. Despite their diminutive size, they're voracious, capable of eating three-times their weight in food each day. Skitterwhelps mature into skittermanders around the age of six, when their stomach-mouths detach and they gain sapience. They retain their large and undiscerning appetite throughout their lives.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Skittermander societies are at once fluid and predictable. They don't create governments, laws, or rules, yet they naturally help others, forming free-form independent communities or joining neighboring societies. Occasionally temporary leaders Skittermanders are excitable, six-armed humanoids with brightly colored fur. Driven by an insatiable desire to help those around them, they perform countless acts of kindness with a chaotic enthusiasm that borders on manic. emerge to direct big projects or teach an important skill, but this is a matter of talent, not power, as skittermanders adore teamwork and naturally defer to whomever has the most expertise to tackle the task at hand. They're individualistic and selfless; chaotic without being anarchic. They value innovation and spontaneity.</p><p>Communities are tight knit and welcoming, and individuals tend to be friendly, sociable, and engaged. Skittermanders are incredibly talkative, quiet only when focused on a particularly challenging task. Upon encountering another silent skittermander, they often fall silent in turn to help them concentrate, respectful of \"the hush\" that's overtaken their fellow. Oddly, most skittermanders have difficulty discerning when non-skittermanders desire silence, instead attempting to fill the silence with incessant conversation.</p><p>It's said that the skittermander home world of Oeddertchonk was conquered effortlessly by the Veskarium. When the skittermanders realized their vesk visitors wanted to occupy their world, they \"helped\" by simply being elsewhere. In truth, Oeddertchonk is simultaneously an occupied planet of the Veskarium and entirely independent. The skittermanders help the Veskarium when they feel like it, but don't acknowledge Veskarium leadership or governance.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>As a people, skittermanders care little for organized religion, instead passing on their beliefs and values through stories, songs, and art. Skittermanders who choose to worship a god favor those with loose organizational structures and an interest in community, mentorship, friendship, nature, or the stars.

With roots on countless worlds, ysoki work alongside larger species helping to establish communities and accomplish tough tasks. From the largest of crowds to the tightest of tunnels, a ysoki always knows how to find their way. Only the foolish overlook the presence of a ysoki in a group!</em></p><hr /><p>Ysoki populations thrived on Akiton, lost Golarion, and several other worlds for millennia before spaceflight accelerated cultural exchange in the Pact Worlds system. The question of whether these ethnicities share common ancestors or were examples of convergent evolution isn't important to most ysoki. Often gregarious, ysoki embrace far-flung \"cousins\" regardless of differences in appearance and heredity.</p><p>Most ysoki love technology and travel, even gravitating toward professions that others find unpleasant. Ysoki often work as junkers, longhaul starship crewmembers, or mechanics squeezing through cramped station corridors, so sure of their own worth that living and working in subpar conditions is often a source of pride rather than shame.</p><p>If you want a character who is adventurous, confident, and curious, try playing a ysoki!</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Keep in touch with a large extended family scattered throughout the stars, with a cousin to visit in every port.</li><li>Collect gadgets encountered in your travels and tinker with everything, even your own cybernetic augmentations.</li><li>Adopt your coworkers and friends into a found family.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Assume you're disorganized and messy until they learn your habits.</li><li>Value your skills with technology but wish you reassembled things as often as you took them apart.</li><li>Depend on you to stick up for others and always get the job done.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Ysoki have whiskered snouts, large ears, and hairless tails, with red or black eyes and fur colors typically in shades of black, brown, gray, and white. Ysoki appearances vary considerably, even within a family unit. Many ysoki have evolved prehensile tails that help them keep their balance and maneuver in zero gravity, as well as keen noses that can identify complex chemicals by smell.</p><p>Ysoki instinctually maintain cleanliness through personal grooming and reinforce these habits throughout their strong social structures. Many ysoki use cosmetics to spice up their looks and favor cybernetic augmentations, often installed at a cousin's bustling street clinic. Ysoki enjoy expressing their personality through fashion, often layering clothing items and accessories into a jumbled fusion. Regardless of attire or profession, ysoki value preparedness and ingenuity, rarely leaving home without a few useful tools and supplies stuffed into a backpack, purse, toolbelt, or cheek pouch.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Ysoki culture values life over credits, framing work as another communal activity to enjoy. Ysoki communities are tightknit and welcoming, always eager to share a meal or swap spare parts with strangers who don't look down on them. Many ysoki adults enjoy distance correspondences with dozens of friends and relatives, reuniting for warren-wide celebrations whenever circumstance brings them back together. Others never leave their homes, serving as pillars of the community and curating collections of useful junk for generations of grandchildren.</p><p>When ysoki aren't exploring or tinkering, they enjoy time in communal warrens planet side or nestled into maintenance tunnels, access corridors, and other spaces often overlooked by larger folk. Ysoki warrens are cluttered with hoarded gadgets and boisterous family members. Hoards full of spare parts and half-finished projects are kept fastidiously clean, and shared living spaces are typically cramped but tidy—though the controlled chaos of a ysoki family's collection might seem like a mess to outsiders.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Ysoki care more about their family than abstract moral concepts, and most ysoki follow their warren's strict social codes even if they flout civil laws. Community is important to ysoki, and they're likely to respect other cultures' social expectations even when they don't agree.</p><p>Ysoki enjoy cultural exchange and acknowledge deities worshipped in their local settlements, but most never lose touch with two cultural touchstones: revering their ancestors and the goddess Lao Shu Po. Lao Shu Po remains important to ysoki culture throughout the stars, with every diasporic ysoki population venerating some version of Grandmother Rat. Lao Shu Po encourages followers to be selfish, engage in trickery, and embodies values most ysoki find indecent, though even upstanding ysoki agree that sometimes these traits are necessary for survival.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong> put your community's interests above your own, maintain good personal hygiene, stay in touch with family</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong> throw away something that might be useful later</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Nicknames are often as important to ysoki as their given names, and they enjoy giving their friends and family monikers based on their appearance or personality, such as \"Snack,\" \"Dot,\" \"Sparks,\" or \"Boom-Boom.\" Many ysoki family names incorporate their ships or home settlements.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Bena, Coponisa, Cors, Datch, Fitch, Goba, Kib, Lolo, Niknak, Quig, Resk, Sim, and Twik.</p><h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Ysoki Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Strength</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Ysoki, Akitonian</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

                    "name": "Versatile Heritage - Boarai",
                    "text": "<p><em>A borai is simultaneously living and dead—a corpse reanimated by its own soul into something just barely living. Despite being corporeal undead, a borai's body is alive, and functions as a living shell that protects their tattered, undead soul, making them something altogether unique.</em></p><hr /><p>Borais are most often created by others through a botched resurrection attempt (whether magical or technological) or necromantic experimentation, or by oneself through sheer stubborn determination and refusal to accept one's demise. Once a person becomes a borai, their living body and undead soul are inexorably bound to one another. A borai's body draws vitality from the soul, preventing external rot and degradation, while the soul tenaciously clings to their body as a vehicle for corporeality and prolonged life. Even if a borai is killed and resurrected or reincarnated, this bond isn't severed, and a borai always comes back as a borai.</p><p>Unlike many forms of undead, borais are the same person they were before their death—they retain their personality, memories, and feelings, and often seek to maintain the emotional connections and relationships they forged in life. Yet, death has left its mark on borais, and many living beings innately sense something is off about a borai, putting a strain on a borai's relationships and other pre-existing social connections. This slow fracturing of friendships and souring of support systems tends to push borais out of their comfort zone, driving them from their homes and past lives and toward the unknown—an experience that leaves many borais jaded, emotionally guarded, or eager to embrace new experiences.</p><p>If you want to play a character who blurs the lines between living and dead, and who's struggling to find their place in the universe, you should play a borai.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Be determined to succeed and refuse to accept your own failure or defeat.</li><li>Embrace new experiences, places, and relationships, perhaps even recklessly or to your own detriment.</li><li>Fear what killed you or avoid the place you died.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Confuse you with a bonetrooper, corpsefolk, necrovite, or other undead, and become surprised when you breathe, eat, or sleep.</li><li>Find your presence unnerving, even if they can't pinpoint why.</li><li>Seek your advice about grief, loss, death, and the afterlife.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Borais appear as they did in life, save that their skin takes on a pallid, waxy hue, and their blood becomes infused with void energy, turning it into a thick black ichor that's clearly visible through their flesh. As their body is alive, borais must breathe, eat, and sleep, and they can be healed, stabilized, and even resurrected like any other living creature. Borais age at radically slowed rates, allowing them to live for a few additional centuries. After this time, a borai's physical body deteriorates to such a degree that the soul can no longer sustain it; the borai then both dies (as living creatures do) and is destroyed (as undead creatures are). Scholars are divided as to whether these souls move on to their appointed afterlives or deteriorate and immediately re-enter the cycle of souls as raw quintessence in Creation's Forge.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Borais are reanimated all throughout the galaxy, from the Pact Worlds to the Vast, making them a diverse people with a scattered population. Most borai are \"born\" on Eox or on other planets where necromancy, religious resurrections, and scientific research into immortality are commonplace. Many borais begin their second lives trying to live as they did before their death, living the same lives and maintaining the same routines and relationships—usually while attempting to hide their undead nature using cosmetics, illusions, or augmentations. This is frequently doomed to failure, either because those around them reject their new state, or because the borai themself feels out of place and distant from their life. While some borais choose to travel the galaxy, others migrate to regions more accepting to undead, such as Eox. As borais require the same comforts as living creatures, they have trouble fitting in even within undead societies. A coalition of borais based out of Absalom Station have banded together to petition the Pact Council for official rights to an asteroid or small moon, to create a home planet, though their requests have yet to bear fruit.</p><p>Borais who've lived over a decade as undead tend to consider family a matter of friendship, loyalty, and love, rather than a matter of genetics or lineage. Found families and sprawling friendship groups are common, though some instead find companionship in mercenary or military units, among members of the same social movements or religious institution, or within the cutthroat hierarchy of a corporation or consortium. Some borais embrace their ominous presence and disconcerting aspects, finding employment as terrifying enforcers or imposing bodyguards, while others seek to overcome and erase the stigma of their undead nature by holding diplomatic positions or taking jobs where they interact with the public.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Borais are influenced by the cultures and societies they were born into, and many continue to worship the same gods and cleave to the same philosophies as they did in life. With time, most borais tend to favor gods of emotion or travel, or who hold sway over the dead, such as Weydan, Zon-Shelyn, or Urgathoa. Those who cleave to modern fads and trends, and who manage to keep up with the fast-paced galactic zeitgeist, instead tend to worship Lambatuin. Many borais take solace in a philosophy known as the Song of Silence, which teaches that undeath is the ultimate goal of life, and that one's mortal life is simply a trial run for one's undead life, where one can take the lessons learned through mortality and apply it to their second life, becoming perfected or enlightened.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong> embrace new experiences, learn from your past, refuse to accept defeat</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong> abandon those who accept you as you are</p><h2>Names</h2><p>No widespread naming conventions exist for borais, and most retain the name that they had in life. Some borais who leave behind their old lives adopt new names of their own creation that they feel better represent their identity heading into the second (or arguably third) phase of their life.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Agavana, Ajanu, Cailis, Enduri, Jiann, Kilarra, Orthei, Ruven, Taylehm, Thel-Sevai, Tis, Yevtori.</p><h2>Boarai Lineages</h2><p>You've returned from the brink of death as a boarai—at once both living and undead. You gain the borai and undead trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. Unlike other undead, you do not gain void healing. You're healed by vitality effects and damaged by void damage, as if you were a living creature. Likewise, you can be stabilized, healed, and brought back to life as if you were a living creature, save that you always return to life in your normal undead state (as a borai). You gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your ancestry already has low-light vision.

Wherever they go and whatever they do, they carry a fragment of the Drift inside them, and they can access that plane and its power through this internal connection.</em></p><hr /><p>Prismenis are inherently \"plugged in\" to the Drift, but the origins of this connection are variable. Most prismenis were born prismenis—some to parents who were particularly devout followers of Triune and some to nonworshippers who happened to be in the Drift when their child was born, hatched, gestating, or conceived. Yet, not all children born in the Drift become prismenis, just as not all those born to pious Triunites become prismenis. Most believe that their lineage is a direct result of Triune's blessing, while others believe it comes down to luck, genetics, or a quantifiable scientific factor that's yet to be identified. Some prismenis aren't born but transformed, becoming prismenis only after prolonged close contact with a spectra, being present at a spectra gathering, or after performing a dangerous task on behalf of Triune. In these instances, becoming a prismeni is considered a blessing, granted by Triune to its chosen children. During the recent Drift Crisis, a year-long event that saw the Drift crash and slowly reboot back to functionality, prismenis were born and transformed with incredible frequency, increasing their population and incidentally giving prismenis greater influence on the galactic stage than ever before.</p><p>Like the Drift itself, prismenis are always in motion. They dislike idleness and monotony and sometimes go out of their way to break routine, traditions, and expectations, simply for the excitement of trying something new. This refusal to settle is often literal, with prismenis changing jobs and homes frequently, or drifting in and out of relationships with abandon, but it's just as often immaterial, with prismenis embracing innovation, experimentation, education, or new fads and trends. Prismenis like to travel and explore, usually to places and planets far from their own, and feel a thrill at experiencing the unfamiliar. Many can instinctively control and understand technology or speak wirelessly with technological creatures. Some can create and harness electricity. To many prismenis, entering the Drift feels like coming home, and most describe it as tranquil or soothing. Some prismenis have a connection to the Drift so strong that their body is sustained or rejuvenated by its energies—the Drift nourishes their bodies, heals their wounds, protects them from harm, and settles their ever-racing thoughts.</p><p>If you want to play a character who embraces change and exploration, or who has a connection to the Drift, you should play a prismeni.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Be easily bored by routine, familiar sights and tasks, and predictable outcomes.</li><li>Love to travel and experience new cultures and societies.</li><li>Have an instinctive understanding of technology.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Assume you know all about the Drift.</li><li>Expect you to worship Triune or be close friends with a spectra.</li><li>Consider you restless, flighty, or irresponsible.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Prismenis look similar in appearance to their parents and are instantly recognizable as a member of their ancestry, yet they have unique features that set them apart visually from their peers, such as metallic gray eyes, rainbow-colored locks, thick cords or wire for hair, or flesh that shimmers with different colors in various light. Many have technological or electrical components naturally integrated into their body or can create and manipulate electricity. While within the Drift, prismenis \"come alive\"—their hair, flesh, and eyes become more colorful and vibrant, their countenance more expressive, and their actions more confident.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>While all prismenis are drawn inexorably to the Drift, they rarely stay in one place long and prefer to remain on the move, making gatherings of prismenis few and far between. Sometimes, prismenis incidentally gather at sites important to spectras or Triune, such as Drift beacons, or at exciting, once-in-a-lifetime events—such gatherings are often termed \"flashmeets,\" though religious prismenis tend to believe these gatherings are the will of Triune, drawing its disparate children together in joy or for a shared purpose.</p><p>Regardless of their homes or lifestyles, prismenis value freedom and change. They take joy in discovery and exploration, both physical and intellectual, and understand that nothing lasts forever—nor would they want it to. Most prismenis trust their own feelings and instincts and understand when it's time to leave a relationship, or show understanding when left in turn. They stagnate under the yoke of routines and traditions that they can't escape.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Thanks to their deep spiritual connection to the Drift, the vast majority of prismenis worship Triune. Those who don't tend to be atheists. Prismenis who worship other gods often favor gods of chaos, change, innovation, or travel, such as Besmara, Prismenis are suffused with the energy of the Drift, a recently discovered hyperspace plane, and are spiritual kin to the spectra who call that plane home. Wherever they go and whatever they do, they carry a fragment of the Drift inside them, and they can access that plane and its power through this internal connection. Oras, Yaraesa, or Weydan.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong> break with tradition, trust your feelings, visit new places</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong> allow others to dictate your decisions or impede your freedom</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Prismenis hold few naming conventions, selecting names that speak to them on a personal level rather than cultural. Most change their name at least twice in their life, once to shed the name given to them by others for one they feel resonates better with their identity, and again whenever they believe they've changed, learned a great lesson, or otherwise have become someone new. They adore nicknames and appellations, both those given to them by others and chosen for themselves.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Anon, Coda, Bellasoar, Ector, Freedom's Wing, Ilioch, Jalavel, Ozarin, Red, Sipri, Szazah, Tizera, Una.</p><h2>Prismeni Lineages</h2><p>You have an innate connection to the Drift. You gain the prismeni trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. While in the Drift, you can automatically pinpoint the location of Drift beacons, Drift drives, Drift engines, and other Driftrelated technology within a 100-mile radius. If you're Piloting a starship that doesn't have a Drift engine, you can serve as a connection between the Drift and that starship. This is a 1-minute activity that has the concentrate trait, and it allows the starship you're Piloting to enter or exit the Drift. Once within the Drift, the starship travels via conventional thrusters, as normal. When you get a critical failure on a Piloting check to Navigate or Plot Course through the Drift, you get a failure instead. You can choose from prismeni feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.</p>"

If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and you must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p><h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2><p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p><h2>Envoy Directive <span style=\"float:right\">Level 1</span></h2><p>Envoys encourage their allies by using directives. A directive is an insight, order, or stratagem that benefits any allies who follow it. Each envoy directive includes a way for the envoy to lead by example. If the envoy takes their own advice and follows through on their own directive before the end of their turn, they unlock an additional advantage for themselves and their allies. By default, most directives have the visual trait, representing the envoy performing guiding motions to assist. However, envoys can choose to replace the visual trait with, or simply add, the auditory trait to represent shouts of encouragement as part of these actions.</p><p>You begin with one envoy directive. You can learn more directives through the envoy class and envoy class feats. You can use any number of directives a round, but you can't use the same directive more than once a round. An envoy's directive and the benefits it grants last until the beginning of your next turn.</p><p>You gain the Get 'Em! envoy directive.</p><h2>Social Mastermind <span style=\"float:right\">Level 1</span></h2><p>You rely on your force of personality and powers of persuasion to influence others, for good or for ill. You gain the activity Size Up and the action Saw it Coming.</p><h2>Leadership Style <span style=\"float:right\">Level 1</span></h2><p>Whether it comes naturally, you trained for it, or you were thrown into a leadership role unexpectedly, you've developed a personal style of leading others. At 1st level, select a leadership style. You become trained in the indicated leadership skill, and you gain the indicated leadership perk.</p><p>At 6th level, certain actions become your acts of leadership and grant you a benefit when you perform those acts. These actions vary depending on your selected leadership style. When you use an act of leadership after issuing one or more envoy directives earlier that turn, you can choose one envoy directive you activated. You grant the lead by example benefits for that directive even if you didn't meet the usual requirements to lead by example. You can do this once per turn.</p><h2>Envoy Feats</h2><p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain an envoy class feat.</p><h2>Skill Feats</h2><p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p><h2>Skill Increases <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>You gain more skill increases than members of other classes. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p><p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p><h2>Adaptive Talent <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>You're quick thinking and adaptable, capable of picking up new skills and talents with little practice or training. During your daily preparations, select one skill feat that you meet the prerequisites for. You gain this skill feat until you prepare again. Since you have this feat temporarily, you can't use it as a prerequisite for a permanent character option. You can use this for effects that temporarily give you access to other abilities, such as taking Multilingual to temporarily learn a new language.</p><p>As your envoy level increases, so does your ability to adapt to new situations. At 9th level and 15th level, increase the number of skill feats you gain this way by 1. You can use feats that you temporarily gain through adaptive talent as a prerequisite for other feats that you temporarily gain through adaptive talent, but you still can't use them as prerequisites for permanent character options.</p><h2>General Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p><h2>Wise to the Game <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>Using your words to influence others is second nature to you, and you easily recognize when others attempt to use the same tactics against you.

If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p><h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2><p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p><h2>Connection</h2><p>All mystics have a supernatural connection with a cosmic force that grants magical powers. The exact nature of your connection can vary widely—you might worship a god or pantheon, embody a metaphysical concept, commune with the souls of your ancestors, or something else—and even mystics who share the same connection may interpret it differently. Your connection determines the type of spells you cast and the spell tradition you choose spells from them, the epiphanies you learn, your additional trained skill, and a harmony that usually grants creatures a special benefit when you heal them with your vitality network.</p><h2>Initial Epiphany</h2><p>You discover the most basic truth of your connection. You learn your connection's initial epiphany focus spell. Epiphany spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to perform, spend time with your bonded allies, or otherwise ponder the nature of your connection. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p><h2>Mystic Bond</h2><p>You use your connection to form a bond between yourself and others, mosty typically your closest companions or those you'll be working with for a prolonged period of time. Forming bonds is different for every mystic, but always involves using a 10-minute activity related to the mystic's connection that requires you to be adjacent to the creature with whom you wish to form. You can maintain a bond with up to 10 other willing creatures and the bond lasts until you or the bonded creature are no longer willing to be part of the bond. You are always considered part of your own bond and do not count toward the 10-creature limit.</p><p>You always knows the general distance and direction toward other bonded creatures, and if they are conscious, unconscious, dying or dead. This ability doesn't work across planes (including when in transit in the Drift), and some special magical or technological effects might intefere with your ability to detect your allies.</p><h2>Vitality Network</h2><p>Your soul supports a network of magical energy that connects and heals those in your bond. Your vitality network has a maximum capacity equal to 6 + 4 Hit Points per mystic level. You gain the Transfer Vitality action that you can use to take Hit Points out of your network and into yourself or your allies as healing.</p><p>Life or death situations help strengthen your bonds with your allies. At the start of each turn in combat, when you regain actions, your vitality network regains 4 Hit Points; if you are master in your connection skill, it regains 6 Hit Points instead; if you are legendary, it regains 8 Hit Points. Your vitality network regains an amount of Hit Points equal to double your level plus your Wisdom modifier when you use the Refocus action.</p><h2>Mystic Spellcasting</h2><p>You are a spellcaster and can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity (see Casting Spells). As a mystic, when you cast spells, you might intone a prayer or hum a song inspired by your epiphanies, you might gesture or dance in patterns that follow the flow of your connection's network, and you might accompany your spellcasting with wisps of energy flowing between you and your bonded allies.</p><p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p><p>As you increase in level as a mystic, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Mystic Spells per Day table.</p><p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier.</p><h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p><h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of mystic spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level mystic, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level mystic, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><table class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr><th>Your Level</th><th>Cantrips</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th><th>10th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The trancendence class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Spell Repertoire</h2><p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your connection. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your connection, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.</p><p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot, you add a spell of the same rank to your spell repertoire. When you gain access to a new rank of spells, your first new spell is always the spell granted by your connection, but you can choose the other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your connection and two other 2ndrank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-rank version of a spell you already know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p><p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p><h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3><p>As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p><h2>Mystic Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a mystic class feat.</p><h2>Skill Feats</h2><p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p><h2>General Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p><h2>Group Chat <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>Those bonded by your mystic connection can always communicate telepathically while visible to one another. As long as two bonded creatures are on the same plane of existence and both are alive, they remain aware of one another's present state, general direction and distance from one another, and if they are conscious, unconscious, dying or dead. You also gain the Force Connection action.</p><h2>Reflex Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>You've honed your ability to dodge dangers and more easily move around the battlefield without taking damage from area attacks. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p><h2>Signature Spells <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>You've learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly, granting you extra control over your spellcasting. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell rank at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p><h2>Skill Increases <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p><p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p><h2>Ancestry Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>In addition to the initial ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry.</p><h2>Fortitude Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>Your physique is incredibly hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p><h2>Advanced Epiphany <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>You understand your connection on a deeper level. You learn your connection's advanced epiphany focus spell.</p><h2>Expert Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>You have formed a more powerful bond with your connection. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics increase to expert.</p><h2>Resilient Soul <span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2><p>The links to your connection and your bonded companions bolster your soul against doubt. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p><h2>Greater Epiphany <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>Your soul aligns more perfectly with your connection. You learn your connection's greater epiphany focus spell.</p><h2>Weapon Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>You defeat your foes with the power of friendship and overwhelming firepower. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to expert.</p><h2>Armor Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>The bond you've forged with your friends is an unbreakable shield you've learned to defend with your life. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p><h2>Master Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2><p>You command powerful magic channeled through your connection. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to master.</p><h2>Legendary Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>Magic flows through your every pore. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to legendary.</p><h2>Perfect Harmony <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>You discover the ultimate truth of your connection and how it comprises the foundation of the cosmos. You learn your connection's perfect harmony.</p><h2>Transcendence <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>You're a true conduit of your connection and manifest your transcendence with powerful spells. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using mystic spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10thrank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the Transcended Existence feat to gain a second slot.</p>"

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p><h2>Stellar Attunement</h2><p>As a solarian, your existence cycles between the aspects of stars. You begin with two aspects: photon (the power of stars to emit heat, light, and plasma) or graviton (the power of stars to attract and imprison objects through gravity). At any time, you are considered graviton-attuned, photon-attuned, or unattuned. Many of your abilities have additional effects based on your current attunement, and some abilities swap your current state of attunement to another state.</p><p>Your default state of attunement is dictated by the favored attunement of your selected stellar arrangement. In encounter mode, you can use the Attune action to re-attune to your favored state. In exploration mode, you can take the Attunement Control activity to ensure that you are in constant control of what state of attunement you begin combat in, regardless of your favored attunement.</p><h2>Solar Manifestations</h2><p>Your deep understanding of the stellar forces of the universe manifests in a variety of tangible ways. You can create and maintain all three different manifestations: solar flare, a solar nimbus, and a solar weapon. Your manifestations temporarily vanish if you become unattuned.</p><h2>Solarian Arrangement</h2><p>As adherents of the cycle of creation and destruction, solarians maintain strong personal beliefs that attach themselves to specific aspects of the cycle. At 1st level, your arrangement grants you a favored attunement, which determines your starting attunement state in combat (unless you've used the Attunement Control exploration action) and what state the Attune action attunes you to. It also provides you with an initial revelation, and proficiency with a particular skill. You also gain advanced and greater revelations at later levels.</p><h2>Solarian Feats</h2><p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a solarian class feat.</p><h2>Skill Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat.

If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and you must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p><h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2><p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p><h2>Suppressing Fire</h2><p>You have a knack for using powerful weapons to hinder your foes and prevent them from operating at their peak. If you make an attack with a weapon that has the area trait (such as from the Area Fire or Auto-Fire actions), you use it in a manner that suppresses your targets. Enemies in the affected area who fail their save against your attack become suppressed until the start of your next turn. A suppressed target takes a –1 circumstance penalty on attack rolls and takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds. Some Soldier abilities and class feats interact further with the suppressed condition.</p><h2>Primary Target</h2><p>You can pick out a single target to bring down greater fire on when unleashing the full devastation of your powerful area weaponry. When you make an attack with an area of effect weapon (such as from the Area Fire or Auto-Fire actions), you can choose a single creature either adjacent to the center point of the attack or the closest to you within a cone or line to be your primary target. After resolving the area of effect attack, make a ranged Strike using your weapon against the selected target. Ignore the unwieldy trait on your weapon when using this action. This follow-up Strike consumes an amount of ammo from the weapon equal to its expend, and you can't make this additional Strike if you don't have sufficient ammo. If two or more creatures are equidistant or closest, you can choose which one is your primary target. If you successfully hit your primary target with this Strike, then that target is suppressed until the start of your next turn. This Strike uses the same multiple attack penalty as your Area Fire or Auto-Fire action but doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.</p><h2>Soldier Fighting Styles</h2><p>As a soldier, you applied yourself to a specific style of combat. Your style determines how you tend to approach combat and often changes how you take advantage of your ability to suppress targets. Choose a soldier fighting style.</p><h2>Walking Armory</h2><p>You wield heavy equipment and can carry it. When determining your Strength for using armor, you can instead choose to use your Constitution modifier. If you already meet the Strength requirement for the armor you're wearing, reduce that armor's Bulk by 1 (to a minimum of 1). In addition, increase the amount of Bulk you can carry before becoming encumbered by half your Constitution modifier rounded up. Increase your maximum carried Bulk by your Constitution modifier.</p><h2>Soldier Feats</h2><p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a soldier class feat.</p><h2>Skill Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat.

If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p><h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2><p>At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training.</p><h2>Paradox</h2><p>Your existence is somehow contrary to the status quo of the universe, causing quantum ripples that empower your spellcasting talent and open doorways to strange worlds. Perhaps you're from an alternate reality or a different timeline, or perhaps you experienced a phenomenon that altered your path, discovered a time-glitching alien device, or developed a thesis on quantum magical theory. Whatever your story, you've become a living paradox.</p><p>At 1st level, select your paradox, which determines the tradition of your spells, additional spells you learn, additional trained skills, and the effects of your quantum field. You also gain Focus Points and special focus spells called warp spells based on your paradox.</p><h2>Anchor</h2><p>Whatever paradox altered the course of your existence, something helps keep you anchored to reality. This may be a physical object you carry, memories of your home or loved ones, or even a concept or ideal you obsess over. At 1st level, select an anchor.</p><h2>Quantum Field</h2><p>You can draw on paradoxical forces to create a reality-warping quantum field. This might manifest as a haze in the air that shows shimmers of alternate realities or appear as walls of glowing magical equations only you can understand. The effects of your quantum field are determined by your paradox. You can further enhance and manipulate your quantum field through your witchwarper feat selections and by casting warp spells. You can activate or extend the duration of your quantum field by using reality-warping magic.</p><p>You have the Warp Reality action, which lets you activate your quantum field. This action gains the arcane or occult trait based on the tradition of your selected paradox.</p><h2>Witchwarper Spellcasting</h2><p>Your paradox grants you magical power. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity. As a witchwarper, when you cast spells, you might describe your revelations about other realities aloud, accompanied by elegant gestures while arcane equations or occult symbols blaze around you.</p><p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p><p>As you increase in level as a witchwarper, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the table below.</p><p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p><h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p><h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of witchwarper spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level witchwarper, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level witchwarper, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><h3><strong>Warp Spells</strong></h3><p>You can create bizarre and powerful magical phenomena known as warp spells. You learn your initial warp spell. These visual flourishes might include floating equations, visions of alternate realities with distinct properties, or subtle alterations as reality warps around you. Warp spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a warp spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to contemplate infinite worlds or conduct quantum magical research.</p><p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p><p>Warp spells have the anchoring trait, unlike other focus spells. This trait means you can only use warp spells while your quantum field is activated, and you can choose to sustain your quantum field when you cast warp spells.</p><p>You learn warps based your paradox.</p><table class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr><th>Your Level</th><th>Cantrips</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th><th>10th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The Quantum Thesis class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Spell Repertoire</h2><p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your paradox. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your paradox. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.</p><p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Witchwarper Spells per Day), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. At 2nd level, select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your paradox and two other 2ndrank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p><p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p><h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3><p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out spells gained from your paradox. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p><h2>Skill Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p><h2>Witchwarper Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a witchwarper class feat.</p><h2>Anchoring Spells <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>You become more familiar with magic you practice regularly, drawing on those spells as another anchor to reality. When you are inside or adjacent to your quantum field and cast a signature spell, the spell gains the anchoring trait.</p><h2>General Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p><h2>Signature Spells <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>You've learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell rank at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p><h2>Skill Increases <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p><p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p><h2>Ancestry Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p><h2>Reflex Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>Your awareness of possible dangers, through incredible analysis or an understanding of the wider multiverse, increases your reflexes. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p><h2>Advanced Paradox <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>Through further experimentation and research, you have discovered secrets of your paradox and unlocked new abilities. You gain the advanced warp spell associated with your paradox.</p><h2>Expert Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>Extended practice of magic has improved your capabilities. Your proficiency ranks for class DC, spell attack modifier, and spell DC increase to expert.</p><h2>Magical Fortitude <span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2><p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p><h2>Greater Paradox <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>Further research into your paradox has uncovered greater secrets. You gain the greater warp spell associated with your paradox.</p><h2>Perception Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p><h2>Defensive Aura <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>The flow of magic through your spellcasting and your defensive training combine to help you avoid attacks. Your proficiency ranks in light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p><h2>Weapon Specialization <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>You inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary.</p><h2>Master Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2><p>Your spells are among the most potent across all possible worlds. Your proficiency ranks for class DC, spell attack modifier, and spell DC increase to master.</p><h2>Transcendent Will <span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2><p>The intense experiences you've accumulated through your studies or travels have strengthened your mental fortitude. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save you get a critical success instead.</p><h2>Legendary Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>You push past the boundaries of magical theory to embody the pinnacle of spellcasting. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to legendary.</p><h2>Quantum Thesis <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>You command the most potent magic and can cast spells of truly incredible power. Add two common 10th-rank spells of your tradition to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using witchwarper spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, and they can't be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You can take the Quantum Research witchwarper feat to gain a second slot.</p><h2>Warped Infinities <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>You have mastered reality and can make it your plaything. The radius of your quantum field becomes 100 feet. When you activate or Sustain your quantum field, you can modify the area of its effect by excluding any number of squares.</p>"
