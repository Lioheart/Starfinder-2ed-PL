The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p><p>As you increase in level as a mystic, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Mystic Spells per Day table.</p><p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier.</p><h3>Heightening Spells</h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of mystic spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level mystic, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level mystic, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><h2>Spell Repertoire</h2><p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your connection. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your connection, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.</p><p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot, you add a spell of the same rank to your spell repertoire. When you gain access to a new rank of spells, your first new spell is always the spell granted by your connection, but you can choose the other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your connection and two other 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-rank version of a spell you already know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p><p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p><h3>Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire</h3><p>As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out epiphany spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>"

As a technomancer, when you cast spells, you use specific arcane gestures, rapid typing, or verbal passphrases to hack magic, often manifesting arcane runes around the tech gear you use to channel your magic power.</p><p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spell database. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p><p>As you increase in level as a technomancer, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Technomancer Spells per Day table.</p><p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier.</p><h2>Heightening Spells</h2><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p><h2>Cantrips</h2><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of technomancer spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level technomancer, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level technomancer, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><h2>Spell Database</h2><p>Your spell database is a technological object that contains a personalized digital database of every spell you know how to cast. You start with a spell database, which you receive for free and must study each day to prepare your spells. Your spell database's form and name are up to you. It might be a comm unit, datapad, a lens integrated into your prosthetic eye, and so on. If it's ever damaged, destroyed, or stolen, it loses its magic, and you can download your spell database onto another technological device as a 10-minute activity. The spell database contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-rank arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. You also add one 1st-rank spell from your programming language.</p><p>Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spell database, of any spell rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access and learn via Learn a Spell. When you gain spell slots of a new rank, you also add an additional spell from your programming language to your spell database.</p><h2>Magic Hacks</h2><p>Magic hacks are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to scroll through your spell database or conduct arcane research. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points.</p><p>At 1st level, you learn an initial magic hack, which is unique to your programming language. You can learn an advanced magic hack with the Advanced Magic Hack feat and a greater magic hack with the Greater Magic Hack feat.</p><h4>TECHNOMANCER SPELLS PER DAY</h4><table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2-table\"><thead><tr style=\"text-align:right\"><th>Your Level</th><th>Cantrips</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th><th>10th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The administrator privileges class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td></tr></tbody></table>"
