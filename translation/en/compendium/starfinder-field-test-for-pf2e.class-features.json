As a mystic, when you cast spells, you might intone a prayer or hum a song inspired by your epiphanies, you might gesture or dance in patterns that follow the flow of your connection's network, and you might accompany your spellcasting with wisps of energy flowing between you and your bonded allies.</p><p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p><p>As you increase in level as a mystic, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Mystic Spells per Day table.</p><p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier.</p><h3>Heightening Spells</h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded upâ€”this is usually equal to the highest rank of mystic spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level mystic, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level mystic, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><h2>Spell Repertoire</h2><p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your connection. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your connection, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.</p><p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot, you add a spell of the same rank to your spell repertoire. When you gain access to a new rank of spells, your first new spell is always the spell granted by your connection, but you can choose the other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your connection and two other 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-rank version of a spell you already know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p><p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p><h3>Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire</h3><p>As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out epiphany spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>"

        "Witchwarper Spellcasting": {
            "name": "Witchwarper Spellcasting",
            "description": "<p>Your paradox grants you magical power. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity. As a witchwarper, when you cast spells, you might describe your revelations about other realities aloud, accompanied by elegant gestures while arcane equations or occult symbols blaze around you.</p><p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p><p>As you increase in level as a witchwarper, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the table below.</p><p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p><h3>Heightening Spells</h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded upâ€”this is usually equal to the highest rank of witchwarper spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level witchwarper, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level witchwarper, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><h3>Warp Spells</h3><p>You can create bizarre and powerful magical phenomena known as warp spells. You learn your initial warp spell. These visual flourishes might include floating equations, visions of alternate realities with distinct properties, or subtle alterations as reality warps around you. Warp spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a warp spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to contemplate infinite worlds or conduct quantum magical research.</p><p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p><p>Warp spells have the anchoring trait, unlike other focus spells. This trait means you can only use warp spells while your quantum field is activated, and you can choose to sustain your quantum field when you cast warp spells.</p><p>You learn warps based your paradox.</p><h2>Spell Repertoire</h2><p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your paradox. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your paradox. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.</p><p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Witchwarper Spells per Day), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. At 2nd level, select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your paradox and two other 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p><p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p><h3>Swapping Spells In Your Repertoire</h3><p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out spells gained from your paradox. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>"
